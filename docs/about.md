Hi! I am Yuchen Zhang, a researcher/engineer interested in Statistics, Natural Language Processing, and Machine 
Learning with a deep understanding of the algorithm theories. I care deeply about science for social good and believe 
that our research in technology and algorithms should benefit the public in a safe and fair way. 

# Experience
Linkedin: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/yuchenalicezhang/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yuchenalicezhang/)

Currently, I am a Software Engineer (Machine Learning)/Research Engineer at [Meta FAIR then GenAI], working on 
Trust and Safety.

My overall [experiences](https://zycalice.github.io/experience/) mainly centered around statistics and law, which in my opinion
helps us to discover truth. Recently I have further developed a deeper interest in mathematics and causal inference. 

# Projects
In the past I have done some interesting [class
projects and personal side projects](https://zycalice.github.io/projects/).
